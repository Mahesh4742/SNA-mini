## ABSTRACT

**Network Graph Analysis: Mapping Hub-Spoke Connectivity in India's Aviation Ecosystem**

This report presents a comprehensive Network Graph Analysis project focused on identifying critical hubs and connectivity patterns in India's domestic aviation ecosystem. Using Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques and graph theory, the analysis examines the Indian civil aviation network to understand hub-and-spoke connectivity patterns that define air traffic flow.

**Key Findings:**

- India's domestic aviation network exhibits a clear multi-hub structure with major metropolitan centers (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore) serving as primary distribution hubs.
- Secondary hubs in Hyderabad, Chennai, and Kolkata play crucial intermediary roles, connecting regional traffic to national networks.
- The network analysis reveals significant traffic concentration patterns, with a small number of hub airports handling a disproportionate share of domestic traffic.
- Interactive visualization and analysis through a Streamlit dashboard enable real-time exploration of network connectivity and centrality measures.
- Centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness) effectively identify both obvious and non-obvious critical nodes in the aviation network.

**Methodology:**

NetworkX library is employed for network analysis with implementation of advanced centrality algorithms and development of an interactive Streamlit-based dashboard for visualization and zone-based filtering analysis. The project integrates passenger traffic data from DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) with network science methodologies.

**Applications:**

This analysis provides actionable insights for aviation infrastructure planning, route optimization, capacity planning, and understanding resilience and vulnerability of India's aviation network.

**Keywords:** Social Network Analysis, Graph Theory, Aviation Connectivity, Hub-Spoke Network, Centrality Measures, NetworkX, Streamlit

# CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Overview

Social Network Analysis (SNA) represents a powerful quantitative framework for studying complex network structures and relational dynamics. This project applies advanced SNA techniques to India's domestic aviation ecosystem, employing graph theory and network visualization to uncover critical insights about hub-spoke connectivity patterns. The analysis leverages the NetworkX library for network construction and implements sophisticated centrality algorithms to identify key hubs and intermediary nodes within India's air traffic network.

## 1.2 Motivation

The motivation for this comprehensive network analysis stems from multiple strategic imperatives in India's aviation sector. Understanding the structural topology of air traffic networks enables data-driven infrastructure planning, optimized resource allocation, and enhanced policy formulation. The project builds upon Phase 1 foundation by introducing advanced analytics and interactive visualizations that provide deeper insights into network connectivity patterns.

Key motivators include:

- Strategic infrastructure planning requiring comprehensive understanding of traffic flow patterns
- Identification of critical hub cities and intermediary nodes for capacity optimization
- Support for aviation policy decisions through evidence-based network analysis
- Real-world application of social network analysis to critical national infrastructure
- Enhancement of Phase 1 capabilities with sophisticated analytical tools and interactive dashboards

The hub-spoke connectivity analysis delivers actionable intelligence for airlines optimizing route planning, airport authorities planning capacity expansions, and government agencies formulating aviation policy.

## 1.3 Objective

The primary objectives encompass both analytical and developmental dimensions:

**Network Construction:** Build a weighted, directed graph representation of Indian domestic air traffic where nodes represent airports and edges represent flight connections weighted by passenger traffic volume.

**Centrality Analysis:** Compute comprehensive centrality measures including degree centrality (direct connectivity), betweenness centrality (intermediary importance), and closeness centrality (network accessibility) for all network nodes.

**Hub Identification:** Systematically identify primary hubs (Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hyderabad) and secondary hubs (Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Jaipur) through quantitative network metrics.

**Geographic Analysis:** Implement zone-based filtering for regional analysis across North, South, and Central India to understand inter-regional connectivity patterns and traffic distribution.

**Interactive Dashboard Development:** Create a real-time Streamlit application enabling interactive network exploration, metric visualization, and dynamic zone-based filtering capabilities.

**Validation Framework:** Validate findings against empirical aviation data to ensure network properties align with real-world traffic patterns and known airport characteristics.

## 1.4 Scope

The project scope encompasses analysis of India's domestic aviation network using 2025 passenger traffic data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The network comprises 129 cities (nodes) connected by 838 routes (edges) with a network density of 0.1015, representing approximately 10% of possible connections.

**Geographic Coverage:** Pan-India domestic aviation network including metropolitan hubs, secondary cities, and remote regional airports.

**Temporal Scope:** Analysis based on 2025 traffic data with potential for future temporal extensions.

**Technical Scope:** Implementation using Python 3.11+, NetworkX for network analysis, Pandas/NumPy for data processing, and Streamlit for interactive visualization.

**Analytical Depth:** Advanced centrality measures, zone-based filtering, route traffic analysis, and dynamic visualizations.

## 1.5 SDG Alignment

This project contributes to **Sustainable Development Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure** by providing data-driven insights for sustainable aviation infrastructure development. The analysis supports efficient resource allocation, reduces operational inefficiencies, and promotes resilient infrastructure planning. Additionally, enhanced connectivity analysis indirectly supports **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** by improving regional accessibility and economic integration.

## 1.6 Existing System

- Zone-based regional analysis functionality
- Integration of multiple network metrics for comprehensive assessment

Existing systems typically provide static reports without real-time analytical capabilities or interactive exploration features essential for strategic decision-making.

## 1.7 Proposed System

The proposed system introduces a comprehensive network analysis framework combining:

**Advanced Analytics Engine:** NetworkX-based implementation of centrality algorithms (degree, betweenness, closeness) for quantitative hub identification.

**Interactive Dashboard:** Streamlit-based web application providing real-time network visualization, zone-based filtering, and dynamic metric exploration.

**Multi-dimensional Analysis:** Support for both weighted and unweighted graph analysis, enabling traffic volume-based and connectivity-based perspectives.

**Geographic Intelligence:** Zone-based filtering system for regional network analysis and inter-regional connectivity assessment.

**Scalable Architecture:** Modular design supporting future enhancements including temporal analysis, international network integration, and predictive modeling capabilities.

## 1.8 Work Plan

The project follows a structured development timeline:

**Phase 1 (Completed):** Foundation development including basic network construction, centrality computation, and static visualization.

**Phase 2 (Current):** Enhanced analytics with interactive Streamlit dashboard, zone-based filtering, and advanced network metrics.

**Phase 3 (Future):** Temporal analysis, predictive modeling, international network integration, and machine learning enhancements.
